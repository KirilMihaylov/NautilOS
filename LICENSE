A "contributor" is any person that holds a non-permanent, revocable at any time by the owner
(and owners), of the Software, non-exclusive license by the owner (or owners) of the Software.

"Contributors" (collective for all people that hold the license that makes them a
"contributor") are hereby granted permission to use, copy, modify, merge, distribute and
publish the Software to and via any medium that is permitted for use by the owner (or owners)
of the Software until their license is terminated.

"Contributors" are restricted from taking any action other than the stated above unless
explicitly permitted to do so by the owner (or owners) of the Software. Such actions are
considered violation of the license and result in immediate termination of that contributor's
license.

The process commonly known as "reverse-engineering" - reversing any part of the process of
obtaining a "binary" form (any other form than "source" form) from a "source" form (the
preferred, most easy to read and understand, form for modifying the Software) - is considered a
violation of the license unless permission is granted by the owner (or owners) of the Software
or it is being done by the owner (or owners) of the Software and will result in immediate
termination of the license of that person or party, if any.
